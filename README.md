An interactive web application that helps you analyze and compare three strategies for using Bitcoin to purchase real estate:

Sell BTC to Buy House: Directly convert Bitcoin to fiat to purchase a house
Borrow Against BTC: Use Bitcoin as collateral for a loan to buy a house
BTC as Secondary Collateral: Apply Bitcoin as supplementary collateral in a self-paying mortgage structure

The application performs detailed financial modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and provides visualizations to help you make data-driven decisions based on your unique circumstances.

ðŸ“‹ Background
This application implements mathematical models for three distinct strategies that Bitcoin holders can use when considering real estate purchases:
Strategy A: Sell BTC to Buy House
The most straightforward approach - convert your Bitcoin holdings to fiat currency and use the proceeds to purchase a house. This approach removes exposure to Bitcoin price volatility but may have significant tax implications.
Strategy B: Borrow Against BTC
Keep your Bitcoin and use it as collateral for a loan. This approach maintains your Bitcoin exposure while accessing liquidity for a home purchase. However, it introduces liquidation risk if the Bitcoin price falls substantially.
Strategy C: BTC as Secondary Collateral
A more complex strategy where both the property and Bitcoin serve as collateral in a self-paying mortgage structure. Excess collateral value can be used to pay down the principal over time, potentially accelerating loan repayment.
